Cycle through energy modes with the left button, and stay there until the
next button press.

This example project uses the EFR32 CMSIS and demonstrates the use of
the RTCC, GPIO and various Energy Modes (EM).

Use SW0 cycle through the energy mode tests available.

This demo application has been made to give a quick demo of the
Energy Profiler from Silicon Labs, including EFR32 energy modes.
To get the most out of this demo, use a Silicon Labs MCU or Wireless
Starter Kit with a debug adapter to connect to the Mini-Simplicity Connector
on the Thunderboard Sense.
